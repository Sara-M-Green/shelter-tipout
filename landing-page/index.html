            <h3>Generate Automatically Calculated Tip Out Percenteges</h3>
            <p>After logging in, you'll be prompted with an overview of the recommended tip out percentages for each department. You will be given the option to begin the daily tip out for the current day, and an option to view your current tips for a given pay-period.</p>

            <h3>Tip Out Calculator</h3>
            <p>You will be prompted through many screens of the tip out calculator in order to distribute appropriately calculated tips to employees in each department. For example, the first prompt will ask for the total credit card tips. You will then move to the next screen where you will enter the total number of food sales. The tip calculator will automatically calculate the tips owed to the back of house based on the recommended percentage. You will have the option to adjust this calculation if you feel that department deserves more or less than the recommended tip out. </p>
            <p>The tip out calculator will move you through each department and have you enter sales correlating to that departmentâ€™s tips. You will always have the option to adjust the number or skip the section if there was no one working in that department. You will have the option to select the employee name who is owed tips when necessary. </p>

            <h3>Tip Out Summary</h3>
            <p>After moving through each section of the tip out calculator, you will be taken to a tip out summary page which will show all off the sales, tip outs for each department including the remaining divided up tips between bartenders. You will have the chance to look everything over before the final submit. You will also be given the option to go back to any particular section of the tip out calculator if adjustments need to be made. </p>
